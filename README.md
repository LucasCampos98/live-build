Ubuntu on Gumstix
=================

This repository provides a method to build an Ubuntu image for various
Gumstix boards such as Overo COMs, DuoVero COMs, and the Pepper SBC.

Usage
-----

1. Install the required tools on your host system:

        $ sudo apt-get install -y git live-build qemu-user-static

2. Fetch this repository.

        $ git clone git://github.com/gumstix/live-build.git

3. Choose an image type and machine for which to build.  This repository
   supports the Gumstix *overo*, *duovero*, and *pepper* machines.

Image Name      | Description
----------------|-------------
*vivid-console* | A developer-oriented console image of Ubuntu 15.04
*vivid-lxde*    | Ubuntu 15.04 "Vivid Vervet" with a lightweight desktop environment (LXDE)
*sid-console*	| Debian Sid console image

4. *Make* it!  You will be prompted for a super-user password then go get some
   coffee.

        $ make MACHINE=<machine> IMAGE=<image> -j4

5. Everything proceeding correctly, binaries for the u-boot bootloader along
   with a root filesystem tarball will be created.  Insert a microSD card to
   your development machine, note the drive name, and then format it.
   **Warning**: this erases anything currently on the microSD card!

       # substitute the path to the drive e.g. /dev/sdd or /dev/mmcblk0 (not the
       # path of a partition e.g. /dev/sdd1 or /dev/mmcblk0p1) in place of <drive>
       $ MACHINE=<machine> IMAGE=<image> scripts/mkcard.sh <drive name>

Customization
-------------
There are numerous ways to customize this root file system.

**1. Change distro, release, or image type.**

As well as Ubuntu images, the [Live Build][1] tool can build images for a
number of Debian-based distributions (e.g. Debian, [Kali][2]) each with different
release versions (e.g. *wheezy*, *utopic*).  Depending on the image *flavour*
and the installed packages, images can provide a variety of different desktop
environments or a stripped down console environement. Start customizing by
copying an existing image directory and adjusting the *config*.

    $ cp -r images/vivid-console images/super-gumstix
    $ sensible-editor images/super-gumstix/auto/config
    $ make MACHINE=<machine> IMAGE=super-gumstix -j4

There are some [great][3] [samples][4].

**2. Pre-install additional packages.**

To include additional packages in a custom image, simply add the package names
(as the would be passed in an *apt-get*) to the list of packages in the
*customization* directory. Carrying on from the previous customization:

    $ echo 'vim' >> images/super-gumstix/customiztion/package-lists/gumstix.list.chroot
    $ make MACHINE=<machine> IMAGE=super-gumstix -j4

As the contents of the *customization* directory get copied over to the
*config* generated by Live Build's configuration step, it is possible to add
locally created *deb* packages by dropping them in a
*customization/packages.chroot* directory.  It is even [possible][5] to extend
the list of package repositories.

**3. Change the Root File System.**

It is possible to run scripts during the construction of root file system as if
the image was actually running (i.e. within a *chroot* under QEMU emulation).
See the *customization/hooks* directory for some samples.

It is also possible to do some boot-time configuration using the *live-config*
[tool][6] (different than *live-build config*).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Note:**

This is not a *build-everything-from-scratch* tool.  This tool
assembles a root file system from pre-compiled packages and provides a
useful framework for adjusting configuration files.  If something
additional needs to be compiled, there are three options:
 * compile it natively (and possibly, create a .deb for future inclusion)
 * cross-build the code---there are a litany of techniques ranging from
   building on emulated ARM hardware (qemu) through a full cross-building
   environment (it gets a [little complicated][6])
 * Use [Yocto][7]!  The Yocto environment excels at cross-building where Debian
   prefers native compilation.
